# Neon Push
A prototype for an arcade game where the goal is to keep your "Player" (aka box)
on screen as various things try to push you off. The prototype is not finished.

Some interesting effects tested in this prototype:
- perlin noise & background waves
- enemies movement being affected by the backgroudn waves
- enemy tracking of player
- "waves" that push enemies away after triggering a bonus score multiplier

# How to Run
Ensure Love2D is installed on your machine, and either run the entire folder
using the love command:
`love neon_push`

Or, simply drop the `neon_push` folder over the application executeable file.
